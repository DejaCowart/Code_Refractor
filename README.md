# Code_Refractoring

![Screenshot](./Assets/WebPageScreensot.png)

For this assignment I altered the existing code to include semantics tags and alt attributes for the icon and image elements.

I started this challenge off by editing the tags in lines (11,26), (27), (28,50), (51,73), and (74,79) to include the semantic tags nav, figure, main, aside, and footer.

I proceeded to alter line 12 to include the class= "seo" to be listed in the h1 tag instead of separatley in a div span tag.

I continued on to add alt attributes to lines 16,19,22,30,37,44,54,61, and 68 towards all of the images and hreg attributes.

To complete I finally edited the title of the HTML Document. Once fully reviewed there were no visible changes to the appearance when opening the file in the web browser.
